# A Simple Timer Web App

[A Simple Timer Web App](https://a-simple-timer.web.app/)

This is a simple timer web app built with React, Material-UI and hosted with Firebase. It's a simple project I started to practice basic React and web development skills.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
