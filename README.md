## About the Project
This is a simple timer web app built with React, Material-UI and hosted with Firebase. It's a simple project I made to practice basic React and web development skills, but it's also functional enough to help me with time management.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
